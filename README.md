## Overview: Read this before editing

The `bin/build` file constructs the `index.html` file using `index.html.tmpl`.
If you need to add/remove/reorder the javascript, or templates that are used,
the build script is what you should change.

Each title hasâ€¦

 - a settings file (`settings/<MAG_CODE>.js`) which is where all
   link URLs, UI text, and other settings should be.

 - a stylesheet (`styles/<MAG_CODE>.scss`) which is responsible 
   for setting the colors, and any other settings necessary before importing
   `styles/_includes/_main.scss` and other shared styles to be used by the 
   app.

 - an images folder (`images/<MAG_CODE>/`) which is adressable from the style
   sheets as `../images`. (e.g., `background: url(../images/logo.png);` would
   show `images/EW/logo.png`, if the title is EW)


DEPLOYING
================================================================================

As of now, you just zip up the "index.html" file in the *-deploy folder and send
that to IT. All assets are loaded over the network.
